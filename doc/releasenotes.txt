NEW!! - ACTUAL DOCUMENTATION, at https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LAVlRcmRX6rNhLlvhrso-S2w18zfqAEjBoZ-J4Yhpo/edit

WHAT IS SIMPLE HIGHLIGHTER

Fundamentally, Simple Highlighter is a Chrome extension that enables you to select ranges of text on a page, and highlight them with a colour. This highlight can then have a note associated with it (a short piece of text). A summary of the highlights and their notes can be displayed by clicking on the popup dialog'). Furthermore, Simple Highlighter can try to remember these highlights and notes, so when you return to the page they are shown again.

* To completely disable or uninstall this (or any other) extension, either go to chrome://extensions , or go to Extensions on the Tools menu,
 or right click on the icon to the right of the URL (choosing disable from this menu disables the ENTIRE extension ALWAYS).

* Many more options, including colours, styles and shortcuts, are available by right clicking on the highlighter icon to the right of the URL and choosing options (if available), OR via the 'menu button' -> 'tools' -> 'extensions' page, OR at the URL chrome://extensions (these all lead to the same place),

* Extensions are disabled on Chrome Extension Gallery pages (ie: this page), but enabled everywhere else.
